## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

My knowledge on making pages responsive to different viewports was tested to a great extent and has also made me improve more on it. I hope to do better than this in the next challenge.



### Continued development

The SVG files are proving abortive for me to work with. I have to work on learning to resize or stretch svg files using css.

### Useful resources

A lot of resources was helpful not just in this project but from the beginning of my learning of web development.

- And lots more. Surely, I will always recommend them days in and days out
